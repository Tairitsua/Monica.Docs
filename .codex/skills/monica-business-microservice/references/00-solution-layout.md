# Microservice Solution Layout

Use this structure when a Monica business solution is intentionally split into independently owned subdomain services.

```text

└── Migrations/
    └── {Subdomain}/                          # Migration project per service
```

Recommended `.slnx` folders should mirror the physical layout:

```text
/src/AppHost/
/src/Shared/
/src/Services/
/src/Migrations/
```

## Mapping Rules

- Keep the same shared platform split across solution styles to reduce learning overhead.
- Put project-agnostic infrastructure extensions into `Shared/Platform.BuildingBlocks/Platform.BuildingBlocks.csproj`.
- Put solution-owned infrastructure composition and integration configuration into `Shared/Platform.Infrastructure/Platform.Infrastructure.csproj`.
- Put cross-service contracts in `Shared/Platform.Protocol/PublishedLanguages`, not inside a service project.
- Put business implementation in the service's own `API`, `Domain`, and `Infrastructure` projects.
- Put `ApplicationService`, event-handler, and background-worker ProjectUnits in the service `API` project under `HandlersCommand`, `HandlersQuery`, `HandlersEvent`, and `BackgroundWorkers`.
- Keep `DomainServices/` as the standard folder for `DomainService` units.
- Keep `Utilities/` in the `Domain` project for pure helpers and name them `Utils*`.
- Do not create `Persistence/` or `Providers/` as default folders. Keep repository implementations, `DbContext`, and EF mapping in `Infrastructure/Repository/`.
- Put migrations beside the service boundary they belong to, not in a global dump folder.
- Keep `ServicesHttp` and `ServicesGrpc` as adapters. Core business logic still lives in shared ProjectUnits.
- Keep AppHost or gateway entry projects down to the project file and `Program.cs`. Do not place business ProjectUnits there.
- Keep `.slnx` folders aligned with the real `src/` tree so the solution view reflects AppHost, shared platform, services, and migrations ownership correctly.
